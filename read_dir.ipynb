      "THE Dhammapada was accepted at the Council of Asoka in 240 B.C. as a collection of the sayings of Gautama; yet it was not put into writing until some generations had passed, and probably contains accretions of later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may be, there is no doubt that it breathes the very spirit of the Teacher, and it has always been used in Buddhist lands as a handbook of \"devotion\" or meditation, in whose solemn precepts men hear the voice of Sakyamuni summoning them to the life of contemplation, of strenuous mind-culture. The world, it tells them, is without permanence or purpose, other than that of expiation; the body is \"a nest of disease\" and the seat of \"desire\"; the mind itself is subject to decay, and capricious, easily led away after false pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet here, in the mind of man, lies his hope of salvation: he may make it a strong tower of defence. Though the world is out of gear,\n",
      "\n",
      "[p. 10]\n",
      "\n",
      "yet, like the Stoic, he may build within himself a kingdom and be at peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the call to \"play the man\" rings out with sturdy confidence. All men may attain, if they will, to happiness and serenity, for, with a modern Stoic, the Buddhist proclaims:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the master of my fate;\n",
      "      I am the captain of my soul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gautama then was no thoroughgoing pessimist; that such a nature was pessimistic at all is due to the age in which he lived. It was the \"sub-conscious mind\" of his nation, and not his own brave spirit, that shut him in to the belief in a ceaseless flux of \"becoming,\" a weary round of pain and retribution. For, by the sixth century B.C., India had passed from the sunny paganism of the Rig Veda into a more thoughtful and more gloomy phase of her religious development.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were not wanting heroic spirits who offered a way of escape, urging men to plunge into asceticism or to court the mystic trance. These were the religious leaders of the day, at whose feet Gautama sat. Others, the great majority, were not ready for such heroic measures. They tried to square the gods, and to live unmolested, or to forget all in the pleasures of sense or the more subtle joys of the intellect.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Gautama, all alike seemed \"to follow\n",
      "\n",
      "[p. 11]\n",
      "\n",
      "wandering fires.\" How degrading this thraldom to immoral and capricious gods! How empty and unsatisfying this mysticism when shorn of all ethical content! Which is more to be pitied, the grasping priest or the foolish worshipper? Which more deluded, the worldling or the devotee?\n",
      "\n",
      "To all alike the Dhammapada has a message of warning and encouragement: to the worldling it holds out the promise of a truer wealth and fame (75, 303) and a more blessed family life (204-7, 302); to the warrior it offers a higher \"chivalry\" (270) and a more heroic contest (103, 104); to the philosopher a deeper wisdom than much speaking (28, 100, 258); to the mystic a purer and more lasting bliss (197-200); to the devotee a more fruitful sacrifice (106 -7); and to the Brahmin a more ennobling service ( section xxvi) and a more compelling authority (73, 74). It is, in fact, possible largely to reconstruct the religious life of Gautama's day from the stanzas of the Dhammapada.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all classes the Buddha has the same message: the great reality is character; all else are shadows not worth pursuing, for none of them strengthens moral fibre, and all alike are tainted with \"desire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Socrates, he saw in himself a physician of the soul, and at times he resorted to surgery to \"stab the spirit broad awake,\" to call men from superstition on the one hand and materialism\n",
      "\n",
      "[p. 12]\n",
      "\n",
      "on the other. With Epictetus he would have said, \"A philosopher's school, my friends, is a surgery, on leaving which you look to have felt, not pleasure but pain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Men needed above all things a moral tonic; there lies the secret at once of his stoicism and his agnosticism; luxury here, a barren mysticism there--these were sapping men's strength, and all the energy they could command was needed in the fight for character. They must strive and agonise to \"cut out desire,\" to push their way \"against the stream,\" to cross life's stormy \"ocean\" and reach the haven of peace. And they must do it alone, not trusting to priest, or sacrifice, or the help of Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this insistence upon morality to the exclusion of \"religion\" Gautama is often labelled \"atheist.\" Nothing could be more unfair: agnostic he may have been or seemed to be; but his was no irreligious spirit: the man who scoffs at the \"other world\" he condemns in uncompromising terms, and Ethics so lofty as this \"Way of Virtue\" never emanated from any but a reverent spirit. It is one of the puzzles of Psychology that so pure a soul ever stopped short at Ethics; yet we must remember that he was a reformer, that reformers are apt to be one-sided, and that during long and painful years he had suffered at the hands of a false \"religiosity\"; the iron had entered into his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "[p. 13]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Buddhists admit neither judge nor creator,\" says Professor de la Vallee Poussin, \"at least they recognise a sovereign and infallible justice--a justice of wonderful insight and adaptability, however mechanically it acts... In my opinion it is a calumny to accuse Buddhists of atheism: they have, at any rate, taken full cognisance of one of the aspects of the divine.\" [**]\n",
      "\n",
      "Gautama believed above all things in a moral order, which, if it is inexorable, is also too righteous to yield to sacrificial bribes:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor in mountain-cave, can one find sanctuary from his sin... Often do men in terror seek sanctuary in mountains and in jungles, by sacred groves or trees: in them there is no safe sanctuary.\" (Dhammapada, 127, 188-9.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So too the Psalmist cries, \"Whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there: if I go down to hell, Thou art there also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Hebrew prophet, too, he strikes a note of strenuous endeavour, of profound dissatisfaction with the actual, and of aspiration after the ideal: unlike the Hebrew and the Christian, he sees in the actual no promise of the ideal. His \"way of salvation\" is therefore monastic; men are to leave the world if they would escape suffering and be truly happy: the layman may one day attain the far-off goal,\n",
      "\n",
      "[p. 14]\n",
      "\n",
      "but for him remains a long and weary pilgrimage, many revolutions of the wheel of existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to Bhikkhus then that these stanzas are in the main addressed. They are comments made by the Teacher to his disciples as occasion arose; and to study them in a sympathetic spirit we of the West must for a time forget our impatience with \"cloistered virtue.\" The saintly life in the world is no doubt a truer ideal than the saintly life out of it, yet saintliness of any type is not to be despised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddhist holds that in contemplative activity a man may best serve the world: is it not true that \"we need reservoirs of every kind of excellence\"? We read in the Dhammapada of the fragrance of holy deeds which pervades the high heavens, and of the light that such a life may cast athwart a dark world. The \"religious\" is more to be envied than kings or even gods, and more fruitful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good is kingship of the earth;\n",
      " Good attaining heavenly birth:\n",
      " World-conquest's good, but better far\n",

      "                      (Dhammapada, 178.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These fruits are \"self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control\" (cf. 261); self-culture is in the end the truest benevolence, says the Buddhist, and the deepest wisdom. That \"wisdom\" of which we shall hear so much in the following\n",
      "\n",

      "pages, is \"a certain over-mastering principle or power, that lays hold, primarily indeed, of the intellect, but through the intellect of the entire personality, moulding and disciplining the will and the emotions into absolute unison with itself, a principle from which courage, temperance, justice, and every other virtue inevitably flow.\" [**]\n",

Instead of passion and romance we shall find self-mastery and a half-humorous sweet reasonableness.

      "AN accurate and sympathetic knowledge of Buddhism and of the spirit of the Buddha is best got from such a book as the Dhammapada, which contains the concentrated essence of the religion. In view of widespread misinterpretation, a literal and accessible translation of this book, therefore, needs no apology. I have worked at the translation throughout with my friend Mr. Wagiswara, himself a Buddhist, and for many years a Bhikkhu; that fact and the appearance of our translation in this series will vouch for sympathetic treatment in the rendering. It is notoriously difficult to find the exact English equivalents of Eastern terms, yet we trust that the spirit has been truly reproduced, and our version aims rather at accuracy than at elegance. Great thoughts are best \"plain-set,\" and moreover it is impossible to reproduce the music of the old slokas of Indian poetry. We have referred frequently to Dr. Fausboll's Latin version, and occasionally to Professor Max Muller's edition in \"The Sacred Books of the East.\" Only where the Sinhalese and Chinese commentaries are really illuminating have I referred to them in the notes, for which I am chiefly responsible.\n",

      "\n",
      "Part of Gautama's work of reform was a \"transvaluation of values,\" a shifting of emphasis; and, like the Stoics, he taught the indifference of the things of sense. \"Men are disturbed,\" said Epictetus, \"not by things, but by the view they take of things.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "1, 2. THESE stanzas contain two ideas which are of the very warp and woof of Buddhism:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) The view depends upon the point of view;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Thought is potent in influencing man's destiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese Commentary illustrates both these ideas: Two merchants listened to the Buddha's preaching; one was delighted, the other angry: men hear what they are prepared to hear. Soon after one was killed, the other became King: so potent is thought!\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Cf. Luke vi, 48.\n",
      "\n",
      "9, 10. The Buddha often used a play upon words to arrest men's attention and help their memory. The Pali of these stanzas contains a pun of this kind, which cannot be imitated in English: Kasavam means either the yellow robe of the mendicant, or impurity, stain, sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "11, 12. The work of Gautama as a preacher lay largely in this directing of men's efforts: the great reality is character; this and this alone is man's business upon earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "All else are \"shadows\" not worth pursuing. Cf. St. John's words: \"Little children, flee idols\" (i.e. \"shadows\"), 1 John v, 21. So St. Paul speaks of covetousness as \"idolatry\"--the pursuit of the great \"shadow,\" Mammon (Col. iii, 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Buddhist puts on the yellow robe, he symbolises his belief that \"virtue is the truest wealth\": the gold of character is alone worth striving after. (Cf. Dhammapada, 75 and note.) On the day of his ordination (upasampada) the candidate adorns himself with all the jewellery he can obtain, and doffs it only to don the yellow robe.\n",
      "\n",
      "15-18. Here and Hereafter: i.e. in this birth and the next. Man may be reborn upon earth, or in one of the\n",

      "hells or in one of the heavens. A demon who does well may become a man or a god: a god who lives unworthily may become a man or a demon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tormented when he goes to hell. The Buddhist Temples are full of frescoes of these torments: men who have killed animals are being slowly devoured by them; other sinners are being forced by demon torturers to climb spiky trees, or burnt in fires most realistically drawn, or made to swallow balls of red-hot iron; low-caste men who have offended the high castes are being crushed by great rocks!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddha's own discourses contain minute detail of such torments. It is not clear whether he was using an argumentum ad hominem, or really believed in a hereafter of physical torment. In any case his moral code has been strangely perverted in modern Buddhism.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. The reward for virtue is twofold--the approval of conscience and a good rebirth.\n",

Nirvana is defined by many such phrases in the Dhammapada--sometimes negative, as here; sometimes positive, as in 23--\"highest freedom.\" Whatever the Supreme Bliss be, it is unlike all human experience save that of the Arahat.\n",

      "22. The lot of the Noble. The word \"Aryo\" meant in Gautama's day Nobleman, or Aryan. He defined the nobleman anew, making nobility consist not in birth, but in conduct. Then he developed the meaning till it stood for Arahats--the experts in his system, those who have attained.\n",

      "\n",
      "Self-control, temperance. Buddhism makes much of the \"cardinal virtues.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "26. The Buddhist motto may be said to be \"Strive without ceasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "27. The joy which is born of meditation plays a great part in Buddhist psychology and ethics. (Cf. Rhys Davids' Early Buddhism, pp. 62-5.)\n",
      "\n",
      "28. Contrast this somewhat Epicurean attitude with St. Paul's exhortation \"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep\" (Rom. xii, 15).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddhist position is in reality midway between the Epicurean and the Christian; it is stoical: the attitude to be assumed towards the \"crowd\" is either mettam, benevolence if (one's own salvation being certain) one can help them: or it is upekha, detachment. \"What can't be cured must be endured.\" Mudita, sympathy, and Karuna, pity, are also duties, but it is no use wasting those upon the blinded and foolish crowd. (Cf. 61, 64.)\n",
      "\n",
      "30. Sakra: i.e. Indra, a high god of Hinduism whom Buddhism has relegated to the rank of an archangel, ruling the Tavatimsa heaven. He is said to have been a young Brahmin who for his zeal in doing good was reborn as Sakra. His human name was Magha. He is regarded by Buddhists as a kind of recording angel. (Childers.)\n",
      "\n",
      "31. Bhikkhu. The \"religious\" of Buddhism is neither \"priest\" nor \"monk\" in the strict sense, for he offers no sacrifice, and he lives not alone, but either with one or two others, or with the \"community.\" The word \"bhikkhu\" means \"mendicant.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "[p. 88]\n",
      "\n",
      "33. In his doctrine of the mind, Gautama was no pessimist; it is by nature fickle and difficult to control: yet nurture can make it stable and obedient. (Cf. especially 40, where Gautama's optimistic attitude to the mind is thrown into strong relief by his pessimistic attitude to the body; if the body be brittle and of slight value, yet the mind may be made strong and precious.) His pessimistic attitude to the body is partly assumed with intent \"to wean men from it,\" and this view is borne out by the genial attitude he takes towards asceticism: once a man has learnt to sit loose to the things of sense he is free to enjoy them. Gautama laid himself open to the name of worldling, and the immediate cause of his death was his courteous acceptance of the rich meal prepared for him by Cunda the smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "34. The simile is obscure: it is apparently only intended to make one point clear--the palpitating effort needed to escape Mara.\n",
      "\n",
      "39. Merit. The desire for merit is almost universal in Buddhist lands; yet Buddha teaches that man should act with his eye fixed not upon \"merit,\" but upon Nirvana. (But cf. 53.) By \"merit\" is meant the credit balance in the bank of character--procuring rebirth to a happy life on earth, or in a heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "46. The flowery shafts of Mara: the insidious advances of the King of Death. Cf. Ps. v, 9: \"They flatter with their tongue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "49. The mendicant is to take what is given him by the faithful, doing them no harm, and taking nothing but what they freely give.\n",
      "\n",
      "51. Cf. Matt. xxiii, 3: \"They say and do not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "54. Natural law is not universally valid in the spiritual world!\n",
      "\n",
      "56. Certain \"rishis,\" having neglected cleanliness in their pursuit of holiness, were ashamed to come into the presence of the gods: \"Never fear,\" said the gods, \"our nostrils are filled with the fragrance of your good deeds\"\n",

      "64. Cf. Ecclus. xxii, 7: \"He that teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together.\"\n",

      "79. A better draught than the soma juice, which led to ecstasy!\n",
      "\n",
      "89. That leads to Arahatship. Sambodhi (Arahatship) has seven component parts, which may be taken to represent the Buddhist ideal of character: mindfulness, wisdom, energy, joyousness, serenity, concentrated meditation, and equanimity.\n",

      "Whose delight is in renunciation. Cf. Bhagavad-Gita xii:\n",

      "occur in the Buddha's teaching. It can be translated in a sense opposed to that here given: viz. \"Best of men is the faithless, the ungrateful, the rebel, who has lost his chance of salvation, who has given up all hope.\" It was spoken by Gautama to some thirty recluses who accused Sariputto of these faults, because he told his master not to preach to him, but to them, \"I already know the truth by experience; these others need it on authority: therefore preach to them.\" Buddha's words express with great skill the two ways in which he and the recluses looked upon his disciple's sturdy confidence. It is of course quite impossible in an analytic language like English to reproduce the puns.\n",

There are occasional gleams of grim humour in the Buddhist books: the following story illustrates both the \"law of apperception\" and the Buddhist attitude to the body. The hermit Maha-Tissa was walking near Anuradhapura meditating upon the transiency of life. A woman who had quarrelled with her husband passed him, gaily dressed and bejewelled, and smiled at him, showing her pearly teeth. When the husband, who was in pursuit, came up with him he called to him: \"Reverend Sir, did you see a woman pass this way?\" \"I saw only a skeleton,\" replied the sage; \"whether it was man or woman I know not\" (Visuddhi-Maggai).\n",

      "175. The East has always held that holy living gives miraculous power. Arahats were said to possess this power (jddhi) of flying through the air, or \"levitation.\" There are still Hindus who claim these powers: but southern Buddhism does not take them seriously. I asked several Buddhists if this power were now attainable. \"Possibly in Thibet,\" they answered. [**]\n",

Conversion: i.e. the first step towards Nirvana, when the attention is fixed upon the Supreme Bliss. \"Sotapattti\" means \"entering the stream,\" up which the convert has to forge his way.

      "The Buddhas. According to the Books there are many Buddhas: some in the dim past, others in the distant future. In Ceylon, Buddhists look wistfully for the coming Buddha--Metteyya or Maitri--the Loving One. In Japan they worship Amida Buddha--an ideal.\n",

This section may be regarded as the Buddhist, analogue of the Beatitudes of Christ: it depicts the blessed life as a life of calm and peace; either solitary or in the company of Buddha's true followers, a man may enjoy that bliss which is the bloom upon virtue in this life: and hereafter the Rest of the Ineffable.\n",
      "\n",
      "207. Like Jesus, Gautama offers his followers a family life whose ties are more intimate and tender than those of blood. In the Sangha they are to find their kinsfolk and a better family life than they have left. (Cf. \"Who is My mother\n",

      "\n",
      "There is, however, a vital difference: the Buddhist Bhikkhu is to shun society that nothing may mar his self-culture: the Christian monk that he may be \"familiar with God alone, and with His Angels.\" When Prince Siddhartha (afterwards the Buddha) heard of the birth of his son Rahula, and they tried to bring him back, he is said to have remarked: \"That is one more bond to be cut.\" The \"Great Renunciation\" involved no less than this.\n",

[**] The seer speaks with a quiet rapture and a serene assurance which convince us as we read, that whether it is Gautama himself who speaks, or whether it is the collective voice of his followers, here is in any case the utterance of a real experience of the soul. Can it be that these men entered behind the veil of sense and time, and that their voices ring down the ages from that mysterious Beyond to which the mystics of all ages have aspired?\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot say; yet it is very clear that if the metaphysical Nirvana is a fantasy, the ethical Nirvana is real enough: and Gautama was above all things an ethical teacher. That\n",

      "\n",
      "we shall understand Nirvana from a perusal of those pages is not likely; that it will attract Western thinkers is not wholly to be desired; but we can at least study the ethical experience of which Nirvana is but the description and the attempted explanation: and a grasp of what Arahatship means is essential to the understanding of Buddhism. The Arahat is one who, through obedience to the preaching of Buddha, has reached that calm state when the will no longer struggles, but is unified and at rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the eagle, after long strain of upward flight, stays poised in mid-air, so the seer reaches the calm and severe heights of character. This is Nirvana in the present world: and Nirvana hereafter may be more mysterious, but it must be of the same kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much as the Christian, experiencing \"the peace that passes understanding,\" interprets in the light of this experience the serenity and calm of the Hereafter, so the Buddhist \"saint,\" having known the quiet and serenity of the unified will, projects this experience into the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "To both alike this future is \"ineffably sublime\"; words fail men when they attempt to speak of the Beyond: and yet we can piece together a picture of their inmost thoughts from such fragmentary descriptions of their experience as they let fall.\n",

      "\n",
      "For whilst \"the burden\" is ultimately bodily existence, yet it is the sinfulness and egoism and pride of the flesh which make that burden so intolerable: the body is in fact a good servant but a bad master, and he who masters his body is already as it were freed from it.\n",

      "\n",
      "And for both teachers it is the perversity of the \"flesh\" that shapes the ideal of escape; though the one longs after the life of dissolution, and the other believes that he will be \"clothed upon\" with a \"glorified body\" hereafter. [**]\n",

The answer seems to be that Buddhism holds out no promise of the reunion of emancipated \"souls\"; Nirvana is the cessation of all personal existence: yet the experience of the peace and joy of Noble Companionship--such companionship and communion of soul as is here depicted--is too good not to be desired.

It is called Nibbana, in that it is a \"departure\" from that craving which is called Vana, lusting. This Nibbana is in its nature single, but for purposes of logical treatment it is twofold, namely, the element of Nibbana, wherewith is yet remaining stuff of life, and the element without that remainder.
